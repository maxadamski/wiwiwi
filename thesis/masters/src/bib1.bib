	abstract = {This work proposes a two-stage model: a prior that generates a CLIP image embedding given a text caption, and a decoder that generates an image conditioned on the imageembedding, and shows that explicitly generating image representations improves image diversity with minimal loss in photorealism and caption similarity. Contrastive models like CLIP have been shown to learn robust representations of images that capture both semantics and style. To leverage these representations for image generation, we propose a two-stage model: a prior that generates a CLIP image embedding given a text caption, and a decoder that generates an image conditioned on the image embedding. We show that explicitly generating image representations improves image diversity with minimal loss in photorealism and caption similarity. Our decoders conditioned on image representations can also produce variations of an image that preserve both its semantics and style, while varying the non-essential details absent from the image representation. We use diffusion models for the decoder and experiment with both autoregressive and diffusion models for the prior, finding that the latter are computationally more efficient and produce higher-quality samples.},

We present a new approach to integrating deep learning with knowledge-based systems that we believe shows promise. Our approach seeks to emulate reasoning structure, which can be inspected part-way through, rather than simply learning reasoner answers, which is typical in many of the black-box systems currently in use. We demonstrate that this idea is feasible by training a long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network to learn EL+ reasoning patterns with two different data sets. We also show that this trained system is resistant to noise by corrupting a percentage of the test data and comparing the reasoner's and LSTM's predictions on corrupt data with correct answers.},

Hence, we propose TransE, a method which models relationships by interpreting them as translations operating on the low-dimensional embeddings of the entities. Despite its simplicity, this assumption proves to be powerful since extensive experiments show that TransE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in link prediction on two knowledge bases.

Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

	title = {Understanding the difficulty of training deep feedforward neural networks},
	abstract = {The objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multilayer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence. 1 Deep Neural Networks Deep learning methods aim at learning feature hierarchies with features from higher levels of the hierarchy formed by the composition of lower level features. They include Appearing in Proceedings of the 13 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2010, Chia Laguna Resort, Sardinia, Italy. Volume 9 of JMLR: WC Weston et al., 2008). Much attention has recently been devoted to them (see (Bengio, 2009) for a review), because of their theoretical appeal, inspiration from biology and human cognition, and because of empirical success in vision (Ranzato et al., 2007; Larochelle et al., 2007; Vincent et al., 2008) and natural language processing (NLP) (Collobert \& Weston, 2008; Mnih \& Hinton, 2009). Theoretical results reviewed and discussed by Bengio (2009), suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g. in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one may need deep architectures. Most of the recent experimental results with deep architecture are obtained with models that can be turned into deep supervised neural networks, but with initialization or training schemes different from the classical feedforward neural networks (Rumelhart et al., 1986). Why are these new algorithms working so much better than the standard random initialization and gradient-based optimization of a supervised training criterion? Part of the answer may be found in recent analyses of the effect of unsupervised pretraining (Erhan et al., 2009), showing that it acts as a regularizer that initializes the parameters in a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù basin of attraction of the optimization procedure, corresponding to an apparent local minimum associated with better generalization. But earlier work (Bengio et al., 2007) had shown that even a purely supervised but greedy layer-wise procedure would give better results. So here instead of focusing on what unsupervised pre-training or semi-supervised criteria bring to deep architectures, we focus on analyzing what may be going wrong with good old (but deep) multilayer neural networks. Our analysis is driven by investigative experiments to monitor activations (watching for saturation of hidden units) and gradients, across layers and across training iterations. We also evaluate the effects on these of choices of activation function (with the idea that it might affect saturation) and initialization procedure (since unsupervised pretraining is a particular form of initialization and it has a drastic impact).},

	abstract = {Modern deep neural network training is typically based on mini-batch stochastic gradient optimization. While the use of large mini-batches increases the available computational parallelism, small batch training has been shown to provide improved generalization performance and allows a significantly smaller memory footprint, which might also be exploited to improve machine throughput. In this paper, we review common assumptions on learning rate scaling and training duration, as a basis for an experimental comparison of test performance for different mini-batch sizes. We adopt a learning rate that corresponds to a constant average weight update per gradient calculation (i.e., per unit cost of computation), and point out that this results in a variance of the weight updates that increases linearly with the mini-batch size \$m\$. The collected experimental results for the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets show that increasing the mini-batch size progressively reduces the range of learning rates that provide stable convergence and acceptable test performance. On the other hand, small mini-batch sizes provide more up-to-date gradient calculations, which yields more stable and reliable training. The best performance has been consistently obtained for mini-batch sizes between \$m = 2\$ and \$m = 32\$, which contrasts with recent work advocating the use of mini-batch sizes in the thousands.},

Concept induction has found applications in ontology engineering, but existing algorithms have fundamental performance issues in some scenarios, mainly because a high number of invokations of an external Description Logic reasoner is usually required. In this paper we present a new algorithm for this problem which drastically reduces the number of reasoner invokations needed. While this comes at the expense of a more limited traversal of the search space, we show that our approach improves execution times by up to several orders of magnitude, while output correctness, measured in the amount of correct coverage of the input instances, remains reasonably high in many cases. Our approach thus should provide a strong alternative to existing systems, in particular in settings where other systems are prohibitively slow.},

This paper introduces a detailed overview of the classification assessment measures with the aim of providing the basics of these measures and to show how it works to serve as a comprehensive source for researchers who are interested in this field. This overview starts by highlighting the definition of the confusion matrix in binary and multi-class classification problems. Many classification measures are also explained in details, and the influence of balanced and imbalanced data on each metric is presented. An illustrative example is introduced to show (1) how to calculate these measures in binary and multi-class classification problems, and (2) the robustness of some measures against balanced and imbalanced data. Moreover, some graphical measures such as Receiver operating characteristics (ROC), Precision-Recall, and Detection error trade-off (DET) curves are presented with details. Additionally, in a step-by-step approach, different numerical examples are demonstrated to explain the preprocessing steps of plotting ROC, PR, and DET curves.},

	abstract = {The "exponential linear unit" (ELU) which speeds up learning in deep neural networks and leads to higher classification accuracies and significantly better generalization performance than ReLUs and LReLUs on networks with more than 5 layers. We introduce the "exponential linear unit" (ELU) which speeds up learning in deep neural networks and leads to higher classification accuracies. Like rectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs (LReLUs) and parametrized ReLUs (PReLUs), ELUs alleviate the vanishing gradient problem via the identity for positive values. However, ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared to the units with other activation functions. In contrast to ReLUs, ELUs have negative values which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero like batch normalization but with lower computational complexity. Mean shifts toward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the unit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect. While LReLUs and PReLUs have negative values, too, they do not ensure a noise-robust deactivation state. ELUs saturate to a negative value with smaller inputs and thereby decrease the forward propagated variation and information. Therefore, ELUs code the degree of presence of particular phenomena in the input, while they do not quantitatively model the degree of their absence. In experiments, ELUs lead not only to faster learning, but also to significantly better generalization performance than ReLUs and LReLUs on networks with more than 5 layers. On CIFAR-100 ELUs networks significantly outperform ReLU networks with batch normalization while batch normalization does not improve ELU networks. ELU networks are among the top 10 reported CIFAR-10 results and yield the best published result on CIFAR-100, without resorting to multi-view evaluation or model averaging. On ImageNet, ELU networks considerably speed up learning compared to a ReLU network with the same architecture, obtaining less than 10\% classification error for a single crop, single model network.},

	abstract = {It is found that embeddings learned from the bilinear objective are particularly good at capturing relational semantics and that the composition of relations is characterized by matrix multiplication. Abstract: We consider learning representations of entities and relations in KBs using the neural-embedding approach. We show that most existing models, including NTN (Socher et al., 2013) and TransE (Bordes et al., 2013b), can be generalized under a unified learning framework, where entities are low-dimensional vectors learned from a neural network and relations are bilinear and/or linear mapping functions. Under this framework, we compare a variety of embedding models on the link prediction task. We show that a simple bilinear formulation achieves new state-of-the-art results for the task (achieving a top-10 accuracy of 73.2\% vs. 54.7\% by TransE on Freebase). Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes the learned relation embeddings to mine logical rules such as "BornInCity(a,b) and CityInCountry(b,c) =\&gt; Nationality(a,c)". We find that embeddings learned from the bilinear objective are particularly good at capturing relational semantics and that the composition of relations is characterized by matrix multiplication. More interestingly, we demonstrate that our embedding-based rule extraction approach successfully outperforms a state-of-the-art confidence-based rule mining approach in mining Horn rules that involve compositional reasoning.},

Presupposing cognition as basis of behaviour, among the most prominent tools in the modelling of behaviour are computational-logic systems, connectionist models of cognition, and models of uncertainty. Recent studies in cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and psychology have produced a number of cognitive models of reasoning, learning, and language that are underpinned by computation. In addition, efforts in computer science research have led to the development of cognitive computational systems integrating machine learning and automated reasoning. Such systems have shown promise in a range of applications, including computational biology, fault diagnosis, training and assessment in simulators, and software verification. This joint survey reviews the personal ideas and views of several researchers on neural-symbolic learning and reasoning. The article is organised in three parts: Firstly, we frame the scope and goals of neural-symbolic computation and have a look at the theoretical foundations. We then proceed to describe the realisations of neural-symbolic computation, systems, and applications. Finally we present the challenges facing the area and avenues for further research.},

However, as the volume and dimensionality of sensory-feedback increase it might be difficult to manually design a multimodal-data fusion system that can handle heterogeneous data. Nowadays, multi-modal machine learning is an emerging field with research focused mainly on analyzing vision and audio information. Although, from the robotics perspective, haptic sensations experienced from interaction with an environment are essential to successfully execute useful tasks. In our work, we compared four learning-based multi-modal fusion methods on three publicly available datasets containing haptic signals, images, and robots‚Äô poses. During tests, we considered three tasks involving such data, namely grasp outcome classification, texture recognition, and‚Äîmost challenging‚Äîmulti-label classification of haptic adjectives based on haptic and visual data. Conducted experiments were focused not only on the verification of the performance of each method but mainly on their robustness against data degradation. We focused on this aspect of multi-modal fusion, as it was rarely considered in the research papers, and such degradation of sensory feedback might occur during robot interaction with its environment. Additionally, we verified the usefulness of data augmentation to increase the robustness of the aforementioned data fusion methods.},

	shorttitle = {The prot√©g√© project},
	doi = {10.1145/2757001.2757003},
	abstract = {Protege has become the most widely used software for building and maintaining ontologies, and the Web-based version has become extremely popular, and it recently exceeded the desktop-client in its degree of usage. Few funded research projects in computer science go on for decades. It‚Äôs even questionable whether any project should be sustained that long. Nevertheless, the Protege project at Stanford University began in the 1980s and is still going strong, helping developers to construct reusable ontologies and to build knowledge-based systems. The recognition of our work at the International Semantic Web Conference in October 2014 with the ‚ÄúTen Years‚Äù Award was a great honor. The award has provided an opportunity f o r reflection‚Äîboth on the Protege project itself and on the need for computational infrastructure in the AI community. 
 
Protege has become the most widely used software for building and maintaining ontologies. It is by no means the only solution, and there are known problems with Protege, but we appreciate that the system is extremely popular. Although his study is now a bit dated, Cardoso (2007) surveyed the Semantic Web community and found that two-thirds of his respondents used Protege. To date, more than 250,000 people have registered to use the software. Many Fortune 500 companies use Protege to build their ontologies. Important government projects, such as the development of the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus (Noy et al., 2008; Figure 1) and the World Health Organization‚Äôs International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11; Tudorache et al., 2010) depend on the software.

Protege currently exists in a variety of frameworks. A desktop system (Protege 5) supports many advanced features to enable the construction and management of OWL ontologies (see Figure 1). A Web-based system (WebProtege) offers distributed access over the Internet using any Web browser and, by design, is much simpler to use for many ontology-engineering tasks (Figure 2). The Web-based version has become extremely popular, and it recently exceeded the desktop-client in its degree of usage. It is extremely handy to be able to point a Web browser to an appropriate server and to begin editing. Like a Google doc, a WebProtege ontology can be easily shared with a distributed group of users who can engage in collaborative authoring activities from wherever they happen to be logged in. The development environment used by the World Health Organization to manage ICD-11 is based on WebProtege (Tudorache et al., 2010).

WebProtege. The Web-based version of Protege offers users and their collaborators the opportunity to share and edit ontologies online, much like a Google doc. Here we see the Ontology for Parasite Lifecycle (OPL), an ontology ... 
 
 
 
Older versions of the Protege desktop system have included support for editing ontologies represented in a frame language (namely, in the OKBC framework developed by the DARPA Knowledge Sharing Initiative in the 1990s; Neches et al., 1991). Comparable functionality has not yet been migrated to current versions of Protege, however. All versions of Protege may be downloaded from the project‚Äôs Web site (http://protege.stanford.edu). They are available under an open-source license. 
 
The paper for which the Protege team won the ‚ÄúTen Years‚Äù Award (Knublauch et al., 2004) describes the first Protege system to support the World Wide Web Consortium‚Äôs recommended Web Ontology Language (OWL). We had been tracking the emerging OWL specification, and Holger Knublauch, then a post-doctoral fellow in our laboratory, worked with the rest of the team to extend Protege to create what was, at the time, the only ontology-development platform that could accommodate nearly the complete OWL specification. Protege‚Äôs support for OWL has been enhanced over the years, particularly through a very successful collaboration with Alan Rector‚Äôs CO-ODE project at the University of Manchester, and recent versions of Protege fully support the latest OWL 2.0 specification. 
 
When people think of Protege, they think of an editor for ontologies, and they think of OWL. Protege did not start out this way, however. Gennari et al. (2003) traced the history of the first 15 years of the Protege project, documenting the many shifts in perspective as Protege progressed from a student project for a Ph.D. dissertation that focused on problems of building knowledge-based systems (Musen, 1989) to a major open-source platform supported by a huge community of diverse users (Musen, 2005).},

The idea is to use an outer product to explicitly model the pairwise correlations between the dimensions of the embedding space. In contrast to existing neural recommender models that combine user embedding and item embedding via a simple concatenation or element-wise product, our proposal of using outer product above the embedding layer results in a two-dimensional interaction map that is more expressive and semantically plausible. Above the interaction map obtained by outer product, we propose to employ a convolutional neural network to learn high-order correlations among embedding dimensions. Extensive experiments on two public implicit feedback data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ONCF framework, in particular, the positive effect of using outer product to model the correlations between embedding dimensions in the low level of multi-layer neural recommender model.

	abstract = {This paper reviews the problem of catastrophic forgetting (the loss or disruption of previously learned information when new information is learned) in neural networks, and explores rehearsal mechanisms (the retraining of some of the previously learned information as the new information is added) as a potential solution. We replicate some of the experiments described by Ratcliff (1990), including those relating to a simple 'recency' based rehearsal regime. We then develop further rehearsal regimes which are more effective than recency rehearsal. In particular, 'sweep rehearsal' is very successful at minimizing catastrophic forgetting. One possible limitation of rehearsal in general, however, is that previously learned information may not be available for retraining. We describe a solution to this problem, 'pseudorehearsal', a method which provides the advantages of rehearsal without actually requiring any access to the previously learned information (the original training population) itself. We then suggest an interpretation of these rehearsal mechanisms in the context of a function approximation based account of neural network learning. Both rehearsal and pseudorehearsal may have practical applications, allowing new information to be integrated into an existing network with minimum disruption of old information.},

	abstract = {This work proposes a simple modification to recover the original formulation of weight decay regularization by decoupling the weight decay from the optimization steps taken w.r.t. the loss function, and provides empirical evidence that this modification substantially improves Adam's generalization performance. L\$\_2\$ regularization and weight decay regularization are equivalent for standard stochastic gradient descent (when rescaled by the learning rate), but as we demonstrate this is {\textbackslash}emph\{not\} the case for adaptive gradient algorithms, such as Adam. While common implementations of these algorithms employ L\$\_2\$ regularization (often calling it "weight decay" in what may be misleading due to the inequivalence we expose), we propose a simple modification to recover the original formulation of weight decay regularization by {\textbackslash}emph\{decoupling\} the weight decay from the optimization steps taken w.r.t. the loss function. We provide empirical evidence that our proposed modification (i) decouples the optimal choice of weight decay factor from the setting of the learning rate for both standard SGD and Adam and (ii) substantially improves Adam's generalization performance, allowing it to compete with SGD with momentum on image classification datasets (on which it was previously typically outperformed by the latter).

In this paper, we present ast2vec, a neural network that maps Python syntax trees to vectors and back, thereby enabling about a hundred data mining techniques that were previously not applicable. Ast2vec has been trained on almost half a million programs of novice programmers and is designed to be applied across learning tasks without re-training, meaning that users can apply it without any need for deep learning. We demonstrate the generality of ast2vec in three settings. First, we provide example analyses using ast2vec on a classroom-sized dataset, involving two novel techniques, namely progress-variance projection for visualization and a dynamical systems analysis for prediction. In these examples, we also explain how ast2vec can be utilized for educational decisions. Second, we consider the ability of ast2vec to recover the original syntax tree from its vector representation on the training data and two other large-scale programming datasets. Finally, we evaluate the predictive capability of a linear dynamical system on top of ast2vec, obtaining similar results to techniques that work directly on syntax trees while being much faster (constant- instead of linear-time processing). We hope ast2vec can augment the educational data mining toolkit by making analyses of computer programs easier, richer, and more efficient.},

While these reasonably advanced reasoners share some notable similarities, it is ultimately the creativity and unique nature of these reasoning engines that have resulted in the successes of each of these reasoners. Of the numerous dissimilarities, the most obvious example might be that while Pellet is written in Java, RACER employs the Lisp programming language and Fact++ was developed using C++. From this and many other distinctions in the system architecture, we can understand the benefits of each reasoner and potentially discover certain properties that may contribute to development of an optimal reasoner in the future. The objective of this paper is to establish a solid comparison of the reasoning engines based on their system architectures, features, and overall performances in real world application. In the end, we expect to produce a valid conclusion about the advantages and problems in each reasoner. While there may not be a decisive first place among the three reasoners, the evaluation will also provide some answers as to which of these current reasoning tools will be most effective in common, practical situations.},

	abstract = {Symbolic knowledge representation and reasoning and deep learning are fundamentally different approaches to artificial intelligence with complementary capabilities. The former are transparent and data-efficient, but they are sensitive to noise and cannot be applied to non-symbolic domains where the data is ambiguous. The latter can learn complex tasks from examples, are robust to noise, but are black boxes; require large amounts of ‚Äìnot necessarily easily obtained‚Äì data, and are slow to learn and prone to adversarial examples. Either paradigm excels at certain types of problems where the other paradigm performs poorly. In order to develop stronger AI systems, integrated neuro-symbolic systems that combine artificial neural networks and symbolic reasoning are being sought. In this context, one of the fundamental open problems is how to perform logic-based deductive reasoning over knowledge bases by means of trainable artificial neural networks. This paper provides a brief summary of the authors‚Äô recent efforts to bridge the neural and symbolic divide in the context of deep deductive reasoners. Throughout the paper we will discuss strengths and limitations of models in term of accuracy, scalability, transferability, generalizabiliy, speed, and interpretability, and finally, will talk about possible modifications to enhance desirable capabilities. More specifically, in terms of architectures, we are looking at Memory-augmented networks, Logic Tensor Networks, and compositions of LSTM models to explore their capabilities and limitations in conducting deductive reasoning. We are applying these models on Resource Description Framework (RDF), first-order logic, and the description logic \${\textbackslash}mathcal \{E\}\{{\textbackslash}mathscr\{L\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{+\}\$respectively.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence agents are required to learn from their surroundings and to reason about the knowledge that has been learned in order to make decisions. While state-of-the-art learning from data typically uses sub-symbolic distributed representations, reasoning is normally useful at a higher level of abstraction with the use of a first-order logic language for knowledge representation. As a result, attempts at combining symbolic AI and neural computation into neural-symbolic systems have been on the increase. In this paper, we present Logic Tensor Networks (LTN), a neurosymbolic formalism and computational model that supports learning and reasoning through the introduction of a many-valued, end-to-end differentiable first-order logic called Real Logic as a representation language for deep learning. We show that LTN provides a uniform language for the specification and the computation of several AI tasks such as data clustering, multi-label classification, relational learning, query answering, semi-supervised learning, regression and embedding learning. We implement and illustrate each of the above tasks with a number of simple explanatory examples using TensorFlow 2. Keywords: Neurosymbolic AI, Deep Learning and Reasoning, Many-valued Logic.},

It is obvious that the combination of these two technologies can bring added value through the creation of Semantic Agent-based frameworks. However, it is also known that these Semantic Web technologies, and the reasoning on ontologies in particular, can rapidly become resource intensive. In order to get a clear view on this problem, we have developed OTAGen, a highly tunable tool to generate customized ontologies and corresponding queries. The generated ontologies can then be used to evaluate at design-time the performance of the Semantic Agent-based platform as a function of the number of ontologies, users and queries.},

Moreover, NeuroSAT generalizes to novel distributions; after training only on random SAT problems, at test time it can solve SAT problems encoding graph coloring, clique detection, dominating set, and vertex cover problems, all on a range of distributions over small random graphs.},

The new calculus addresses performance problems due to nondeterminism and model size‚Äîthe primary sources of complexity in state-of-the-art OWL reasoners. The latter is particularly important in practice, and it is achieved in HermiT with an improved blocking strategy and and an optimization that tries to reuse existing individuals rather than generating new ones. HermiT also incorporates a number of other novel optimizations, such as a more efficient approach to handling nominals, and various techniques for optimizing ontology classification. Our tests show that HermiT is usually much faster than other reasoners when classifying complex ontologies, and it is already able to classify a number of ontologies which no other reasoner has been able to handle.},
