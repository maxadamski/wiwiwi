# Pentago rules

* Pentago is played on a 6 by 6 board, divided into four 3 by 3 grids.
* There are two players ( X and O ) who alternate turns. 
* The goal of each player is to get five units in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
* Each turn, a player places an item in an empty space in some grid, then chooses a possibly different grid to rotate 90 degrees left or right.
* If both players get 5 in a row at the same time, or the last move is played with no five in a row, the game is a tie. If a player makes five a row by placing an item, there is no need to rotate a grid : the player wins immediately.
