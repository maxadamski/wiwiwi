# Pentago rules

Pentago is a two-player board game.  
It is a variation of a 5-in-a-row game, played on a 6×6board, where each player must rotate one of the board quadrants by 90 degrees in any direction, after placing a stone.  
The rotation is compulsory unless the player achieves the winning condition immediately after placing the stone.  
Since the rotation allows multiple 5-in-a-row’s toemerge simultaneously, a board position where the winning conditions of both players are satisfiedis considered to be a draw
